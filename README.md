# PetVision-SVM
The SVM-based image classification model built to distinguish between cat and dog images. The workflow includes dataset preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, evaluation, and predictions. The goal of this project is to showcase how traditional machine learning algorithms like SVM can be effectively applied to visual data.
